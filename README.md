#My personal vimrc

Feel free to use it / modify it / do whatever with it.

Install instructions:

	git clone https://github.com/dapetcu21/vimrc.git
	cd vimrc
	./install.sh

It's as simple as that.

If you need C/C++ autocompletion, then you should run the installer as such:

	./install.sh --with-clang
